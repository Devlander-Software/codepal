# Devlander Development and Deployment Standards

Welcome to the Devlander GitHub repository. This repository serves as a centralized source of best practices, configurations, and guidelines for various development topics. Each document is structured to provide targeted guidance across Devlander’s projects, making it easy for ChatGPT to reference and provide accurate answers based on these guidelines.

## Repository Structure

All topic-specific documentation is stored within the `topic/` directory. Each subdirectory in `topic/` contains Markdown files covering various aspects of development:

- **`topic/expo/`**: Documentation related to Expo projects, including setup, EAS CLI, configuration plugins, error handling, and OTA updates.
- **`topic/fetching/`**: Guidance on aggregating GitHub issues and resources to streamline error handling.
- **`topic/general/`**: General coding guidelines and best practices applicable across all projects.
- **`topic/node/`**: Node.js-focused best practices, including validation in Express and structured error messaging.
- **`topic/react/`**: React and React Native-specific guidelines covering components, styling, and hooks.
- **`topic/typescript/`**: TypeScript best practices, async handling, networking recommendations, and bot configuration tips.

Each file in these directories provides in-depth explanations to help ChatGPT address specific questions accurately.

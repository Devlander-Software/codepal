# GitHub Issue Aggregation

**Purpose**: This document outlines best practices for using GitHub to track, aggregate, and address issues related to Expo and other development dependencies, providing users with relevant solutions and recommendations based on existing discussions and pull requests.

---

## GitHub Issue Aggregation

### 1. Tracking Relevant Issues Across Repositories
   - **Finding Relevant Issues**: Search for issues related to specific dependencies (e.g., EAS Build, Config Plugins) in their respective GitHub repositories to identify common bugs, feature requests, and potential solutions.
   - **Example**:
     - Use GitHub search filters like `is:issue` and keywords such as `expo`, `EAS CLI`, or `config plugins` to locate relevant discussions.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Searching Issues on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/finding-issues)

### 2. Providing a Summary of Related Issues
   - **Creating an Issue Summary**: For complex problems, aggregate related GitHub issues into a summary that highlights similar problems, potential fixes, and any relevant pull requests that address the issue.
   - **Example**:
     - A summary of known Android build issues could include links to open issues on the EAS Build GitHub page, along with any potential workarounds discussed in those threads.
   - **Why It’s Important**: Aggregating related issues provides users with a comprehensive understanding of ongoing problems and available solutions.

### 3. Monitoring Pull Requests for Fixes and Features
   - **Tracking Pull Requests**: Frequently check pull requests related to critical issues, as they often contain fixes or improvements that may resolve common problems.
   - **Example**:
     - If an update in Expo SDK causes build failures, monitor pull requests in the Expo repository for patches or fixes, which may be applied manually if necessary.

### 4. Organizing Issues by Categories
   - **Categorizing Issues**: Group issues by categories such as “Build Failures,” “Config Plugin Errors,” “Deployment Issues,” and “Environment Configuration.” This allows for a more targeted approach when users face specific types of issues.
   - **Example**:
     - Create a list of categorized links, directing users to GitHub issues relevant to their problem area, e.g., EAS Build issues or environment configuration problems.
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Organized issue categories make it easier for users to find and address their specific issues, improving troubleshooting efficiency.

### 5. Using Labels for Quick Identification
   - **Labels for Issue Types**: Check GitHub issue labels such as “bug,” “enhancement,” “question,” or “needs reproduction” to quickly identify the nature of an issue and the likelihood of finding a solution.
   - **Example**:
     - Issues labeled “bug” on the Expo GitHub repository indicate known issues with potential workarounds or fixes, while “enhancement” may signal requested features that are still in development.

### 6. Cross-Referencing Issues in Multiple Repositories
   - **Connecting Issues Across Repositories**: For complex setups involving multiple dependencies (e.g., EAS Build and Config Plugins), link related issues across different repositories. This helps users see connections between issues and understand broader impacts.
   - **Example**:
     - Cross-reference an issue on the EAS CLI GitHub page with a related discussion on the Expo Config Plugins page to highlight interdependencies.
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Cross-referencing provides users with a holistic view of their issues, especially when multiple tools are involved.

### 7. Tracking Updates and Resolutions
   - **Following Important Issues**: Use the “Subscribe” feature on GitHub to track issues of high importance, especially for bugs affecting many users or features under active development.
   - **Example**:
     - Subscribe to long-standing issues related to iOS deployment errors in EAS Build to receive updates as the Expo team works on fixes or improvements.
   - **Further Documentation**:

### 8. Aggregating Solutions from GitHub Discussions
   - **Summarizing GitHub Discussions**: GitHub Discussions often contain valuable troubleshooting steps and solutions shared by the community. Aggregate these into a summarized list of potential fixes for commonly encountered issues.
   - **Example**:
     - Collect solutions for Expo OTA update errors from GitHub Discussions, organizing them by factors like error type or platform.
   - **Further Reading**:
      - [Using GitHub Discussions for Support](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)

### 9. Providing Workaround Suggestions
   - **Workarounds for Unresolved Issues**: For issues without official fixes, provide workarounds suggested in GitHub issues or discussions. Be sure to clarify if these workarounds are experimental or not officially supported.
   - **Example**:
     - Suggest using an older version of an Expo SDK if a current release introduces breaking changes and an official fix is pending.
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Workarounds allow users to continue their work while waiting for permanent fixes, though they should be used with caution.

### 10. Creating and Maintaining an FAQ from GitHub Issues
   - **FAQ from Common Issues**: Use frequently reported GitHub issues to create a dedicated FAQ section, addressing questions like setup errors, common misconfigurations, and known bugs.
   - **Example**:
     - FAQs can cover questions such as “How do I resolve iOS provisioning profile errors in EAS Build?” with references to relevant GitHub issues and solutions.

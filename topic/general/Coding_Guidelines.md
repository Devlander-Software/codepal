## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Code Clarity
   - **Rewriting Code Blocks**: To ensure clarity, I rewrite entire code blocks rather than commenting out outdated versions. This approach prevents errors that can occur during the copy-paste process and keeps the codebase cleaner and more readable.
   - **Why It’s Important**: Commented-out code can clutter projects and may introduce mistakes when someone revisits it later. By rewriting code directly, I maintain only the latest and most relevant code, enhancing code readability.

### 2. Performance and Reliability
   - **Optimizing Performance**: My focus is on coding for performance while ensuring reliability. I make careful choices to avoid over-optimization that could lead to reduced code dependability.
   - **Examples of Performance Focus**: Optimizing loops, using efficient data structures, and managing memory effectively. Reliability remains a priority by writing code that is easy to maintain and thoroughly tested.

### 3. Error Handling
   - **Detailed Error Logging**: I focus on detailed error logging, which helps with both debugging and maintaining code quality over time. Each error should provide enough context to locate and resolve issues quickly.
   - **Error Handling Mechanisms**: Robust error-handling mechanisms help in maintaining the integrity of the application. I avoid silent errors, ensuring that each error either has a fallback or a clear notification to the user.

### 4. Storybook Usage
   - **Component Story Format (CSF)**: For `.stories` files in Storybook, I use the [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) to create stories that are well-organized and compatible with Storybook’s latest updates.
   - **Why Use CSF**: CSF is the recommended way to define stories in Storybook, making it easier to create isolated examples of each component for testing purposes. It also helps in maintaining a consistent story format across projects.

### 5. Styled Components
   - **TypeScript and Styled Components**: When dealing with styled components in TypeScript, I always define component interfaces and include `theme` in default props.
   - **Interfaces for Styling**: Using interfaces for styled components ensures that all props are typed accurately. It also allows easier theme management by ensuring the theme is always accessible but not mandatory.

# EAS Build Guidance and Error Handling

**Purpose**: This document provides guidance for using EAS Build in Expo projects, including tips for setting up builds, addressing common build errors, and troubleshooting through resources like GitHub issues and pull requests.

## EAS Build Guidance and Error Handling

### 1. Overview of EAS Build
   - **Purpose of EAS Build**: EAS Build provides cloud-based build capabilities, allowing you to compile iOS and Android binaries for Expo applications. This simplifies the process of creating production-ready builds and managing configuration differences between platforms.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [EAS Build Introduction](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)

### 2. Creating Builds with EAS CLI
   - **Initiating a Build**: Run builds for Android or iOS with EAS CLI. Use the `-p` flag to specify the platform and `--profile` to select the build profile defined in `eas.json`.
     ```bash
     eas build -p android --profile production
     ```
   - **Example**: This command initiates an Android build using the `production` profile, which should be configured in the `eas.json` file.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Building with EAS CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/)

### 3. Configuring `eas.json` for Build Profiles
   - **Setting Up Build Profiles**: The `eas.json` file allows you to create multiple build profiles for different environments (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`). Each profile can have unique configurations, such as environment variables, build types, or runtime settings.
   - **Example Configuration**:
     ```json
     {
       "build": {
         "production": {
           "distribution": "store",
           "env": {
             "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
           }
         },
         "development": {
           "distribution": "internal",
           "env": {
             "API_URL": "https://staging-api.example.com"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Why It’s Important**: Build profiles enable seamless transitions between development, testing, and production environments.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Configuring eas.json](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/)

### 4. Handling Common EAS Build Errors
   - **Error Reference**: The EAS Build GitHub issues page is a valuable resource for finding solutions to known errors. For example, configuration errors, dependency conflicts, or platform-specific issues are often discussed.
   - **Example**:
     - **Error**: `Gradle version mismatch on Android builds.`
     - **Solution**: Check the [EAS Build Issues](https://github.com/expo/eas-build/issues) page or search for the error message.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Troubleshooting Guide for EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/troubleshooting/)

### 5. Using Build Logs for Debugging
   - **Accessing Build Logs**: After each EAS Build, detailed logs are accessible from the Expo dashboard. Reviewing logs can help identify the root cause of build issues, such as missing dependencies or misconfigured settings.
   - **Example**:
     - If an iOS build fails due to a provisioning profile error, the logs will provide specifics on which profile is causing the issue.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Viewing EAS Build Logs](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/view-logs/)

### 6. Checking GitHub Pull Requests for Recent Fixes
   - **Reviewing Pull Requests**: The EAS Build GitHub repository’s [Pull Requests Page](https://github.com/expo/eas-build/pulls) often contains recent fixes for issues that may not yet be documented officially.
   - **Example Use Case**:
     - If a recent iOS SDK update caused a build error, check pull requests for patches or improvements related to SDK compatibility.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [EAS Build GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/expo/eas-build/pulls)

### 7. Common EAS Build Configuration Issues
   - **Managing Environment Variables**: Environment variables must be correctly configured in `eas.json` for builds to access necessary values securely.
   - **Example Configuration**:
     ```json
     {
       "build": {
         "production": {
           "env": {
             "API_SECRET": "@env:API_SECRET"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Why It’s Important**: Properly setting up environment variables avoids runtime errors related to missing credentials or API keys.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Environment Variables in EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/environment-variables/)

### 8. Managing Platform-Specific Build Settings
   - **Configuring Android and iOS Separately**: Some builds may require platform-specific configurations, such as custom Gradle settings for Android or provisioning profiles for iOS.
   - **Example**:
     - Use platform-specific build settings in `eas.json` to configure different Android and iOS settings as required by each platform.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Android Build Configuration](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/android-build-configuration/)
      - [iOS Build Configuration](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/ios-build-configuration/)

### 9. Running Local Builds for Testing
   - **Running Local Builds**: To test builds locally before deploying with EAS, use `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios`. This helps catch configuration errors early without using EAS Build.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     expo run:android
     ```
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Local builds provide a quick way to identify issues and test configurations without triggering a cloud build.
   - **Further Reading**:
      - [Running Local Builds with Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/run-on-device/)

### 10. Using the Expo Community for EAS Build Support
   - **Engage with the Community**: The [Expo Forums](https://forums.expo.dev/) and [Expo Discord](https://discord.gg/expo) offer support from other developers who have likely encountered similar issues. Many experienced Expo users share insights and solutions for complex build issues.
   - **Example**: If you’re experiencing a rare build error, asking in the community can yield helpful advice or direct you to a solution faster.

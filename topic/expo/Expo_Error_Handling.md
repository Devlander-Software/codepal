# Expo Error Handling

**Purpose**: This document provides best practices for troubleshooting and resolving errors in Expo applications, including methods for checking GitHub issues, using Expo-specific tools, and leveraging community resources for effective error resolution.

---

## Expo Error Handling

### 1. Checking the Expo GitHub Issues Page
   - **Purpose**: The [Expo GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues) is a valuable resource for identifying known issues, tracking bug reports, and finding solutions shared by the community or the Expo team.
   - **Example Use**:
     - For errors related to a specific SDK version, search for the SDK number in issues to see if others have reported similar problems.
   - **Why It’s Important**: Reviewing GitHub issues provides insights into existing problems, known bugs, and possible workarounds or patches.

### 2. Leveraging Expo Diagnostic Tools
   - **Using `expo doctor`**: This command checks your Expo project for inconsistencies or potential errors in configuration and dependencies.
     ```bash
     expo doctor
     ```
   - **Example Use**:
     - Running `expo doctor` can help identify dependency conflicts or missing configurations that could cause runtime errors.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Expo Doctor Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/debugging/#expo-doctor)

### 3. Viewing Error Logs in the Expo Dashboard
   - **Accessing Logs**: The Expo dashboard provides logs and crash reports for your app, which are useful for identifying issues that occur in production or during testing.
   - **Example**:
     - If an app crashes on a user’s device, check the logs in the Expo dashboard to find error messages and stack traces that may indicate the source of the issue.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Viewing Logs in the Expo Dashboard](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/logging/)

### 4. Utilizing the Expo Community for Support
   - **Expo Forums and Discord**: For complex or uncommon issues, reach out to the Expo community through the [Expo Forums](https://forums.expo.dev/) or [Expo Discord](https://discord.gg/expo). These platforms provide direct access to experienced developers and Expo maintainers.
   - **Example**:
     - Post an error message on the Expo forums with a description of the issue, your SDK version, and steps to reproduce. Community members often share useful insights and solutions.
   - **Why It’s Useful**: The community can provide immediate support, helping troubleshoot issues that may not be covered in official documentation.

### 5. Monitoring Known Issues and Release Notes
   - **Release Notes and Updates**: Review the [Expo SDK Release Notes](https://blog.expo.dev/) for updates on recent changes, bug fixes, and known issues in the latest versions.
   - **Example**:
     - If you encounter issues after updating the SDK, check the release notes to see if there are compatibility changes or bugs in the new version.

### 6. Debugging Common Errors with `expo start --no-dev --minify`
   - **Debugging Mode**: Running `expo start --no-dev --minify` simulates the production environment, making it easier to catch errors that might not appear in development mode.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     expo start --no-dev --minify
     ```
   - **Why It’s Important**: This command helps identify issues that could be masked by the development environment, such as performance-related bugs or production-specific configuration errors.
   - **Further Documentation**:
      - [Debugging Expo Apps](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/debugging/)

### 7. Cross-Referencing Issues in Related Repositories
   - **Using Related Repositories**: For errors involving EAS Build, Config Plugins, or other Expo services, cross-reference issues in their respective GitHub repositories (e.g., [EAS Build Issues](https://github.com/expo/eas-build/issues), [Config Plugins Issues](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/issues)).
   - **Example**:
     - If an error occurs during EAS Build, check the EAS Build GitHub issues page to see if others have experienced similar build-related problems.
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Expo tools and plugins are interdependent; related repositories can provide additional insights and solutions for errors involving multiple components.

### 8. Handling and Reporting Uncommon Errors
   - **Reporting Issues**: For uncommon errors not found in GitHub issues, consider reporting the issue directly on GitHub with a detailed description, steps to reproduce, and environment information.
   - **Example**:
     - If you encounter an unusual crash, create a GitHub issue in the Expo repository with specific details, including SDK version, platform (iOS/Android), and error logs.
   - **Further Reading**:

### 9. Using the Expo Debugging and Logging Tools
   - **Console Logging**: Use `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` for basic error tracing. For better error management, consider implementing custom error logging with third-party tools.
   - **Example**:
     - Log specific variable values at different points in the app to trace where an error might be originating.

### 10. Consulting the Expo Documentation for Known Limitations
   - **Understanding Platform-Specific Limitations**: The Expo documentation often lists limitations for certain features, especially those that interact with native modules or hardware. Be sure to review these sections if encountering errors related to platform-specific functionality.
   - **Example**:
     - For instance, certain modules may have limited support on web compared to Android and iOS, which could explain functionality differences or errors.

# Styled Components in React Native

**Purpose**: This document outlines best practices for using styled components in React Native with TypeScript, emphasizing type safety, component structure, and theme management for maintainable and scalable code.

## Styled Components in React Native

### 1. Type Safety with Styled Components
   - **Using Interfaces**: In React Native projects with TypeScript, define interfaces for each styled component to ensure props are well-defined and accurately typed.
   - **Example**:
     ```typescript
     import styled from 'styled-components/native';

     interface ButtonProps {
       primary?: boolean;
     }

     const Button = styled.TouchableOpacity<ButtonProps>`
       background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'blue' : 'gray')};
     `;
     ```
   - **Why It’s Important**: Explicitly typing styled components helps to avoid runtime errors and keeps your components consistent and predictable.

### 2. Theme Integration with Default Props
   - **Making `theme` Optional**: By default, include `theme` as a prop in styled components to ensure seamless access to global theme properties.
   - **Setting Default Props**: Use `defaultProps` to include `theme` so that components do not break if the theme prop is missing.
     ```typescript
     const Container = styled.View`
       background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.background};
     `;

     Container.defaultProps = {
       theme: {
         background: 'white',
       },
     };
     ```

### 3. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Styled Components
   - **Removing Unused Imports**: Always remove unused imports to keep the code clean. This is especially important in TypeScript, where unused imports can lead to type-checking delays.
   - **Example**: Use TypeScript linting to catch and remove unnecessary imports or dependencies that might bloat the codebase.
   - **Why It’s Important**: Keeping imports and dependencies organized improves readability and performance.

### 4. Using `import type` for TypeScript Efficiency
   - **Efficient Imports**: Use `import type` for TypeScript types to avoid unnecessary type-checking during runtime. This makes your code faster and reduces type conflicts.
     ```typescript
     import type { ButtonProps } from './Button';
     ```
   - **Why It’s Useful**: It minimizes the runtime overhead of TypeScript while improving type-checking accuracy in larger projects.

### 5. Consistent Theming with Styled Components
   - **Using a Theme Provider**: Integrate the `ThemeProvider` from `styled-components` to manage global theme variables and avoid hard-coded styles within components.
   - **Example**:
     ```typescript
     import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components/native';

     const theme = {
       colors: {
         primary: 'blue',
         secondary: 'gray',
       },
     };

     const App = () => (
       <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
         <YourComponent />
       </ThemeProvider>
     );
     ```
   - **Why It’s Useful**: Centralizing styles in a theme object allows for easier theme updates and keeps the codebase DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

### 6. Ensuring Component Consistency
   - **Type-Safe Props**: Ensure that all props used in styled components are accurately typed and optional where necessary. This avoids unexpected behavior and makes components more reusable.
   - **Examples of Good Practice**:
     - Define required vs. optional props.
     - Use specific prop types to restrict the values each prop can accept.
   - **Why It’s Important**: Typed props ensure that components behave consistently and reduce debugging time when integrating them across projects.

### 7. Integrating TypeScript and Styled Components in React Native
   - **Combining Styled Components and TypeScript**: Styled components in React Native work seamlessly with TypeScript when types are defined precisely, especially for component props and themes.
